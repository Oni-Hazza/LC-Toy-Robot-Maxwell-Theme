#LC Toy Robot Maxwell Theme
Replaces the toy robot sound with the maxwell cat theme.

##BepInEx Install
Merge the plugins folder from [latest release](http://www.github.com/Oni-Hazza/LC-Toy-Robot-Maxwell-Theme/releases/latest) with the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

As long as the file name in `BepInEx/plugins/RobotToySound` is called `maxwell.wav` you can basically replace it with whichever sound you want.
