# LC Toy Robot Maxwell Theme
Replaces the toy robot sound with the maxwell cat theme.

## BepInEx Install
Merge the plugins folder from [latest release](http://www.github.com/Oni-Hazza/LC-Toy-Robot-Maxwell-Theme/releases/latest) with the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

As long as the file name in `BepInEx/plugins/RobotToySound` is called `maxwell.wav` you can basically replace it with whichever sound you want.

### Changes
* 1.1.4 - Should be able to find audio file when installed with the mod manager now too (ty Tropingenie)
* 1.1.3 - Stopped null reference from the duck ruining my day
* 1.1.2 - Fixed also changing the chattering teeth audio.
* 1.1.1 - Friend (MazzVG) made the audio more fitting.
* 1.1.0 - Quieter audio.
* 1.0.0 - Release.
